                    <div class="about">International Mother Language Day is a worldwide annual observance held on 21 February to promote awareness of linguistic and cultural diversity and to promote multilingualism. First announced by UNESCO on 17 November 1999, it was formally recognized by the United Nations General Assembly with the adoption of UN resolution 56/262 in 2002. Mother Language Day is part of a broader initiative "to promote the preservation and protection of all languages used by people of the world" as adopted by the UN General Assembly on 16 May 2007 in UN resolution 61/266, which also established 2008 as the International Year of Languages. The idea to celebrate International Mother Language Day was the initiative of Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, 21 February 1952 is the anniversary of the day when the Bengalis of the then-Pakistani province of East Bengal (which is now the independent state of Bangladesh) fought for recognition of their Bengali language. It is also observed by the Indian Bengalis of the Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Tripura and the union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

                    <div class="about">Mother Language Day, celebrated on February 21st in Bangladesh, is a profound and heartfelt event that honors the Language Movement of 1952, where brave souls sacrificed their lives to ensure the recognition of the Bangla language. The day begins with early morning processions known as "Prabhat Pheri," where people walk together, often singing patriotic songs, to pay homage to the language martyrs. Thousands gather at the Shaheed Minar, the iconic monument symbolizing their sacrifice, to lay wreaths and flowers in a solemn tribute. The entire country is immersed in cultural programs, with poetry recitations, songs, and traditional dance performances celebrating the rich heritage of the Bangla language. Educational institutions host special discussions and competitions, emphasizing the historical significance of this movement. Television and radio stations broadcast dedicated programs, while communities come together for art exhibitions and seminars, fostering a deep sense of linguistic pride and cultural identity. It's a day of national reflection, where the spirit of unity and respect for linguistic diversity is felt profoundly throughout Bangladesh.
